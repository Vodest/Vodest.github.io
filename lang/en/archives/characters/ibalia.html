I struggle to wake up...<br>Nothing. Darkness, the silence of the vast void screams at me.<br>I feel it, the agonizing pain that is this feeling... fear.<br>A heartless war machine, through and through, feeling fear.<br>How far have I've fallen from my former glory?<br>And I feel it, like a bolt shot through my head.<br>Am I waking up? Or is this merely the sweet release of death, all alone in this empty place?<br>...am I seeing light?<br>Hope?...<br>Or a mockery of my mortality?...<br>It's no use... I have to scream...<br>and the quiet...<br>it's at me...<br>What will become of me?...<br>Blind, Mute, Feel- and Senseless?<br>...<br>I feel something...<br>Is it water?<br>rain?..<br>No... it's Tears...<br>...<br>Am I?<br>Am I crying?<br>Fearing death?<br>I, a beast made for war?<br><br><i>I finally feel them now.<br>Feelings which I had kept within all my life.<br>Feelings I called unnecessary.<br>They come in my last moments to mock me, ridiculing my death.<br>Yet suddenly I see...<br>The once glorious world I kept, now standing before me in ruin.<br>All my efforts torn to pieces.<br>Everything I knew crumbled.<br>All we had built for decades, destroyed.<br>Nothing of my world is left.<br>Nothing left to calm me...</i><br><br>Lady Scarlet...<br>I dare not to leave the ruins that surrounded me, but something was calling for me...<br>And as I move from the rubble that halfway buried me, I see wounds all over my upper body.<br>A miracle that I'm even alive...<br>What happened to me? I do not remember...<br>Each step halls through the floors, followed by the dripping of my own blood.<br>I've rarely been wounded enough to see my own blood be spilled...<br>a delicate black liquid, deep as the dark waters of our land...<br>But I wasn't the only one who faced severe damage, we seem to have fought against an invasion of some sort.<br>All mortals, Human in fact.<br>Their blood, the same crimson red.<br>It always fascinated me how different yet equal we are...<br>My brethren, all dead.<br>Their hollow corpses littering the floors and halls.<br>The glory of our  castle turned into a terrifying bloodbath.<br>The devastation I felt, I will feel for eternity.<br>As I proceed, the stench of blood and rot gets stronger and more vile.<br>There is a gate, closed shut and held down by a dozen of corpses and husks of my Calamitous brethren.<br>They died protecting this gate... but why?<br>Did they give up their lives protecting me?<br>Oh Lady, what has happened?<br><br>Everyone is dead...<br>Is this pity... I feel?<br>But they were nothing but mass-production units...<br>but brethren none the less...<br>They would follow each order, even throw away their lives to save their siblings...<br>... It make me sad ...<br>Why?...<br>...I should proceed...<br>I didn't want to look around me anymore...<br>...but curiosity struck me as I see two silhouettes standing outside on the plaza.<br>Is it you... Lady Scarlet?<br>As I got out and limp towards the two figures, I feel the looming sense of dread in the air...<br>I feel as my wounds turn out to be more than just serious.<br>I was close to death's door as I lay my eyes on two corpses.<br>Lady Scarlet...<br>...The God-slayer...<br>My psyche is nearing it's breakdown, my body has given up long ago...<br>This man... he seems familiar...<br>This pale being, White hair and ... black blood?...<br>It doesn't matter...<br>They all died...<br>...left me...<br>...I'm alone...<br>I have failed my only task...<br>no one I can blame,<br>No one that can keep me at bay...<br>It's futile...<br>...I want to cry...<br>yell...<br>...and fall asleep...<br><br>...and it all seems to finally end...<br><br>at least I believed so.<br><br><br><br><br>I can feel him waging his wrath across the lands, seeking for the reincarnate of the God-slayer...<br>...He believes I am dead...<br>Such a fool he is, my older brother...<br>It was him, wasn't it?<br>Trying to wake me up?...<br>His name...<br>who?...<br>Who is he?...<br>...heh...<br><br>Forgive me brother, for I cannot remember you...<br><br><br></p>
