			 <p><!--<b>I was the second.<br>The second creation to emerge from the deeds of a malicious God.<br>War was his only reason, making us only his tools of conquest.</b><br><br><i>I and my brethren were not made like any other being.<br>We were not born,<br>not incubated,<br>not conceived.<br>Even in our first breath we were bathing in blood.<br>Blood of an ancient being.<br>We all knew it was of the blood of what they called the God-slayer.</i><br><br>I was not like my brethren.<br>I did not like what was done to the God-slayer.<br>Neither the way we were treated.<br>And so I fled the grasps of the malicious God in my earliest stages of life.<br>It wasn't easy.<br><br>Everything has shown hostility towards me,<br>and I knew there was no way back once I fled.<br>But it did not matter, I was given the ability to fight,<br>and so I shall use it to fight for my own.<br><br>At first, I was nothing more than sentient armory.<br>A possessed piece of armor, that was it.<br>But as more time went by, I managed to manifest a body much more different to the likes of my brethren.<br>I became a lot more "human" that day,<br>learning the limits to my strength when bound to flesh.<br><br>Though my body wasn't complete yet, I still had the horns that were given to me at birth,<br>bearing the skin more akin to a daemon.<br>Such is my fate, I presume.<br><br>I made many attempts trying to convince locals of my non-hostility,<br>but to no avail.<br>I was and still am to this day nothing more than a Daemon to them.<br>That did not matter much, as I've grown acquainted to the isolation and solitude that my path had brought me.<br><br>Yet I wasn't aware of the looming danger that I had brought onto myself;<br>For my attempts made them fearful of my presence,<br>and what they fear is what they get rid of.<br><br>I was hunted, day and night, by those that I had made aware of me.<br>They went far away from their homes to track me,<br>far away just to get rid of me.<br>And they managed.<br>Managed to harm and capture me.<br>I thought they would kill me, but they were a lot more worse than I could have imagined.<br>They attempted in torturing me,<br>being successful in harming my flesh.<br>They did not seem to get any satisfaction,<br>seeing that I did not react to the harm they've done to my flesh.<br>So they went on in "studying" my limits.<br>Managed to cut of a horn of mine, leaving me with one.<br>As soon as they realized that I couldn't be worthy of any information, they made plans of finishing me off.<br>That is when I broke free from them and proceeded to maim and harm anyone who stood in my path,<br>Intending not to kill any.<br>I had no reasons to kill,<br>Their attempts to torture me were useless,<br>The horns I had were something I couldn't care less of.<br>But they kept on insisting to kill me for simply existing.<br>Being a threat to them.<br><br>The further out of their village I got, the more desperate their efforts became.<br>Soon there were not many able to threaten or harm me,<br>but they still didn't give up.<br>Tenacious little beings.<br>What I did not expect was them sending their young to do their deed.<br>They had no other choice it seems.<br>Thought I wouldn't harm them, guessed right.<br>They were no threat, barely equipped with small knives or throwables.<br>Though determined, they actually did not seem too keen either.<br>Kept their distance and let me get closer to the woods.<br>But the closer I got, the more they would start speaking to me.<br>Finally, some that would try to be diplomatic about things.<br>I thought.<br><i>"P-please surrender, Miss Daemon!"</i><br>My instincts are itching me.<br>The kid reeks of fear.<br>I don't even need to smell the fear,<br>the kid would be happier being surrounded by wolves than standing behind me.<br>Demanding me to give up?<br>I didn't think much of it and just wave him off, turning back to the woods.<br><i>"Y-you understand me?! or do you?"</i><br>I look at the kid, giving of quite a confused look.<br>I tell it, not to bother me any more.<br><i>"But we need you to come back!"</i><br><br>Why is that?, I wonder.<br>Doesn't matter, I've got better things to do than staying here<br>and slowly developing a masochistic taste.<br>I proceed to the woods and ignore any more ramblings of the kid,<br>that is... until I feel something stuck in my back.<br>Did the kid just try to stab me?<br>I sigh.<br>Doesn't matter.<br>Turn around to see the kid.<br>Yes, definitely stabbed me in the back.<br>The shocked expression on the kids face, still remember it until this day.<br>Shoo it away like nothing happened.<br>It is terrified.<br><br><i>"I-I'm sorry, Miss Daemon!"</i><br>Completely turn around to the kid, kneel down and look it dead in the eyes.<br><i>"Kid, do you believe in Gods and Angels?"</i><br><i>"Y-yes!"</i> it responds.<br><i>"Then let me tell you that these same Gods and Angels you all believe in created Me and my kin.<br>Yet you who call yourself an image of the gods try to destroy what they have made, don't you feel shame in doing so?"</i><br>The Kid doesn't respond.<br>It starts crying.<br><br>Doesn't matter, I have to leave now.<br>I feel bad for that kid, but I have an Idea.<br>I put on my warmest smile and tell it:<br><i>"You have seen a Daemon bleed, kid. Be proud.<br>Go tell your parents that you finished me off or something similar, just convince them of my passing."</i><br>The Kid nods and runs back with the bloodstained knife he used,<br>I now remember again that I bleed black, unlike those beings.<br><br>And so I disappear into the wild, living there for what seems like an eternity.<br>The lands of Havenstedt, as they are called now...<br>Interesting...<br>I wonder, what would my name be, if I was given any?</p>-->
