	 <p>Projekt: Siegel is my most recent attempt to publish a fictional story that I, Enes A. Windgassen, also known as "Vodest" have written a long time ago. My focus is on building the website to compliment the Story and it's contents.

     <br><br>As of now, on the 10th of July, the first Chapter - titled "Regret" - has been officially released for reading, though the following parts are still in making. I thank all of whom have visited the site and wish all of you, who have begun reading a cheerful time!</p>
