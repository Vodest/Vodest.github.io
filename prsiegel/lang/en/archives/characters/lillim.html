				 <p class="blocktext"><b>Lillim, the Orphan.</b><br><br>Lillim was born a single child in a simple and modest family, living a simple life for quite some time. Her mother, Erena, raised her until her 5th birthday, due to her father being drafted for military service to defend Havenstedt, her hometown. She has never seen her father face-to-face, only heard about him about stories from her mother and sightings from locals on the battlefield. On her 5th birthday, her mother was kidnapped and executed by mercenaries. Lillim witnessed this and fled into the nearby forest where she got shot and mortally wounded by one of the mercenaries who left her for dead. In her dying breath, she saw the aspect of the Scarlet Witch embracing her, giving her a "second chance in life". What she doesn't know is that somewhere inside her, something has awakened.<br>After her resurrection, she was found by a Soldier who brought her to the nearest orphanage, where she resided for three years. She was mocked and bullied for her rather unusual appearance which lead to her fleeing after an incident, where her pale hair got forcefully cut short by other children. It was deep into the winter when she barely managed to find a last resort to safe herself from freezing to another death.<br><br>She now lives inside a lost casern on the rim of Havenstedt.<br>Inside the lost casern also lives the young avianian "Klang" and Annalott, an avienian crossbreed, both accompanying Lillim in her darkest times.<br>Lillim learnd fast that what she called her humanity, may not even be as human as she always thought...<br><br><b>And thus began one of her brighter chapters in life...</b>
