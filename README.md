Projekt: Siegel

Projekt: Siegel is my most recent attempt to publish a fictional story that I have written a long time ago.
My focus is on building the website to compliment the Story and it's contents.

As of now, on the 10th of July, the first Chapter - titled "Regret" - has been officially released for reading, though the folowing parts are still in making.
I thank all of whom have visited the site and wish all of you, who have begun reading a cheerful time!

As of the 10th of July, no English translations have been made, though this is to be changed immediately.

UPDATE: 10th of July - 2:50PM~ an raw english translation has been submitted, though character archive files and chapter I are still in the making.
